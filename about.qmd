Hi, I'm Rigan, and welcome to my website!

I'm a data manager and university tutor, based in Melbourne, Australia. I have a background in genomics, and through my work as a research assistant discovered a love for all things data management. I'm interested working to understand how we can work with data better, since in many medical research projects, it's a real privilege to be able to work with patient data. I am also passionate about data visualisation, and how we can communicate the results of our research in a way that everyone can understand, and ensuring we make our research as accessible as possible.

This website will document my learnings and adventures in data science.

When I'm not geeking out over data, I can be found crocheting (which involves a surprising amount of maths), reading, or travelling.
